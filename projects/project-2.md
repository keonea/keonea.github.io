summary: A game where a dot collects apples that my team made in ICS 111.

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/dot.png">

For our ICS 111 class my team and I decided to create a game where you control a dot on a 2D array and you collect red dots.

Vacay is implemented using Eclipse, a Java application platform. Within two weeks, we created a game that implements sa 2D array board where a dot can travel on and collect the red dot.

I was responsible for where the red dot will appear and also helped with the 2D array board and how the black dot travels on the board.
