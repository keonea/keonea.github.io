## Reflect on Javascript

Last week was the first time I used Javascript, and I can tell you that I am impressed by how easy it is to use. What I learned from Java and C carry over to Javascript. It is also incredibly easy to just start writing code down for a function you can use. I still do not know if you can use object oriented programming, because I have only gone so far as to complete the freecodecamp. I was surprised at how we initialize variables. You do not have to state which type of variable it is, you just have to give a variable a name and it detects what type of variable it is. I was also surprised by the fact that you do not need a main function to run your code. You just put the function you need to run after your code and it runs.
The daily WODs are pretty helpful because they challenge you to think on the spot. Their difficulty is just right too. They are not hard enough to get me stressed and anxiety ridden, but they are hard enough to get me thinking critically. The freecodecamp was also a really good way to get us introduced to Javascript. I basically learned all I needed to know to have a basic understanding of Javascript from working on that website for five hours. Overall, I like what this class is doing and I cannot wait for the upcoming weeks.
