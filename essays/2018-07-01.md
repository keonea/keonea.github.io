 <div> A design pattern is a general and reusable solution that applies to many common problems. Think of rugs as a design pattern. Two people can have the same rug as long as it ties the room together. In code a design pattern could be code that applies to a common problem that can be formatted and reused to suit another problem that is similar to the common problem that it was created for.
