## What is a design pattern?

 <div> A design pattern is a general and reusable solution that applies to many common problems. Think of rugs as a design pattern. Two people can have the same rug as long as it ties the room together. In code a design pattern could be code that applies to a common problem that can be formatted and reused to suit another problem that is similar to the common problem that it was created for.

 <div> In my Software Engineering class we used templates to create our personal website for our group projects. 
  We reused the original code to turn it into a website that helps students find out where their classes are being held.  </div>
