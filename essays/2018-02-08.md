## Reflect on Coding Standards

I see ESLint and all other forms of ways to make sure you are using the correct coding standards as a positive. 
It is important to learn the universal coding standards, because you need them when you have a job and are trying to have other people understand your code. 
If you have a completely unique and different style of coding than the normal way of coding than you will probably not have other people understand what you are trying to do. Learning coding standards can also help you learn new coding languages. 
Nearly all coding languages use the same or similar coding standards so you can just learn how the new language applies to the coding standards you already know. 
ESLint helps train you and make sure that you are doing what is normal and will be universally understood. 
Seeing that green checkmark when I run my code and it works is very satisfying and it means my code has no errors in terms of coding standards. 
When I see the green checkmark and the code does not do what I want then that is one of the worst feeling when you code. 
This means you probably have a runtime error and you have to go through your code and see what is wrong with your code.
